Sample Type / Medical Specialty: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary<br/>
Sample Name: Pacemaker Insertion
<br/>
Description: Insertion of transvenous pacemaker for tachybrady syndrome<br/>
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)<br/>
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tachybrady syndrome.
<br/><br/>
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tachybrady syndrome.
<br/><br/>
OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: Insertion of transvenous pacemaker.
<br/><br/>
ANESTHESIA: Local
<br/><br/>
PROCEDURE AND GROSS FINDINGS: The patient's chest was prepped with Betadine solution and a small amount of Lidocaine infiltrated. In the left subclavian region, a subclavian stick was performed without difficulty, and a wire was inserted. Fluoroscopy confirmed the presence of the wire in the superior vena cava. An introducer was then placed over the wire. The wire was removed and replace by a ventricular lead that was seated under Fluoroscopy. Following calibration, the lead was attached to a pacemaker generator that was inserted in a subcutaneous pocket in the left subclavian area.
<br/><br/>
The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated and closed with Interrupted 4-O Vicryl, and the skin was closed with staples. Sterile dressings were placed, and the patient was returned to the ICU in good condition.
