<body>Sample Type / Medical Specialty: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary<br/>
Sample Name: Stress Test Dobutamine
<br/><br/>
Description: Dobutamine stress test for atrial fibrillation.<br/>
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)<br/>
INDICATIONS: Atrial fibrillation, coronary disease.
<br/><br/>
STRESS TECHNIQUE: The patient was infused with dobutamine to a maximum heart rate of 142. ECG exhibits atrial fibrillation.
<br/><br/>
IMAGE TECHNIQUE: The patient was injected with 5.2 millicuries of thallous chloride and subsequently imaged on the gated tomographic SPECT system.
<br/><br/>
IMAGE ANALYSIS: It should be noted that the images are limited slightly by the patient's obesity with a weight of 263 pounds. There is normal LV myocardial perfusion. The LV systolic ejection fraction is normal at 65%. There is normal global and regional wall motion.
<br/><br/>
CONCLUSIONS:
<br/>1. Basic rhythm of atrial fibrillation with no change during dobutamine stress, maximum heart rate of 142.
<br/>2. Normal LV myocardial perfusion.
<br/>3. Normal LV systolic ejection fraction of 65%.
<br/>4. Normal global and regional wall motion.
