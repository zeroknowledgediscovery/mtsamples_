Sample Type / Medical Specialty: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary<br/>
Sample Name: Lung adenocarcinoma Path Report
<br/><br/>
Description: Probable right upper lobe lung adenocarcinoma. Specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled with the patient's identification and "Right upper lobe lung".
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)<br/>
CLINICAL HISTORY: Probable right upper lobe lung adenocarcinoma.
<br/><br/>
SPECIMEN: Lung, right upper lobe resection.
<br/><br/>
GROSS DESCRIPTION: Specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled with the patient's identification and "Right upper lobe lung". It consists of one lobectomy specimen measuring 16.1 x 10.6 x
4.5.cm. The specimen is covered by a smooth, pink-tan and gray pleural surface which is largely unremarkable. Sectioning reveals a round, ill-defined, firm, tan-gray mucoid mass. This mass measures 3.6 x 3.3 x 2.7 cm and is located 3.7 cm from the closest surgical margin and 3.9 cm from the hilum. There is no necrosis or hemorrhage evident. The tumor grossly appears to abut, but not invade through, the visceral pleura, and the overlying pleura is puckered.
<br/><br/>
