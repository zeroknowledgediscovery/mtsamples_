Sample Type / Medical Specialty: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary<br/>
Sample Name: Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) - 3
<br/><br/>
Description: Coronary Artery CTA with Calcium Scoring and Cardiac Function
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)<br/>
EXAM: Coronary artery CTA with calcium scoring and cardiac function.
<br/><br/>
HISTORY: Chest pain.
<br/><br/>
TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Coronary artery CTA was performed on a Siemens dual-source CT scanner. Post-processing on a Vitrea workstation. 150 mL Ultravist 370 was utilized as the intravenous contrast agent. Patient did receive nitroglycerin sublingually prior to the contrast.
<br/><br/>
HISTORY: Significant for high cholesterol, overweight, chest pain, family history
<br/><br/>
Patient's total calcium score (Agatston) is 10. his places the patient just below the 75th percentile for age.
<br/><br/>
The LAD has a moderate area of stenosis in its midportion due to a focal calcified plaque. The distal LAD was unreadable while the proximal was normal. The mid and distal right coronary artery are not well delineated due to beam-hardening artifact. The circumflex is diminutive in size along its proximal portion. Distal is not readable.
<br/><br/>
Cardiac wall motion within normal limits. No gross pulmonary artery abnormality however they are not well delineated. A full report was placed on the patient's chart. Report was saved to PACS.
