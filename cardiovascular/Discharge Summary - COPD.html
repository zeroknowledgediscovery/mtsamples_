PROCEDURES:<br/>
<br/>1. Chest x-ray on admission, no acute finding, no interval change.
<br/>2. CT angiography, negative for pulmonary arterial embolism.
<br/>3. Nuclear myocardial perfusion scan, abnormal. Reversible defect suggestive of ischemia, ejection fraction of 55%.
<br/><br/>
DIAGNOSES ON DISCHARGE:
<br/>1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation improving, on steroids and bronchodilators.
<br/>2. Coronary artery disease, abnormal nuclear scan, discussed with Cardiology Dr. X, who recommended to discharge the patient and follow up in the clinic.
<br/>3. Diabetes mellitus type 2.
<br/>4. Anemia, hemoglobin and hematocrit stable.
<br/>5. Hypokalemia, replaced.

The patient started on IV steroid, bronchodilator as well as antibiotics.
<br/><br/>
He also complained of chest pain that appears to be more pleuritic with history of coronary artery disease and orthopnea. He was evaluated by Cardiology Dr. X, who proceeded with stress test. Stress test reported positive for reversible ischemia, but Cardiology decided to follow up the patient in the clinic. The patient's last cardiac cath was in 2008.
<br/><br/>
The patient clinically significantly improved and wants to go home. His hemoglobin on admission was 8.8, and has remained stable. He is afebrile, hemodynamically stable.
<br/><br/>
ALLERGIES: LISINOPRIL AND PENICILLIN.
<br/><br/>
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
<br/>1. Prednisone tapering dose 40 mg p.o. daily for three days, then 30 mg p.o. daily for three days, then 20 mg p.o. daily for three days, then 10 mg p.o. daily for three days, and 5 mg p.o. daily for two days.
