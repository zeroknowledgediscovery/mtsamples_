Sample Name: Pigtail Catheter Insertion
<br/><br/>
Description: Left hemothorax, rule out empyema. Insertion of a 12-French pigtail catheter in the left pleural space.<br/>
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)<br/>
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left hemothorax, rule out empyema.
<br/><br/>
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left hemothorax rule out empyema.
<br/><br/>
PROCEDURE: Insertion of a 12-French pigtail catheter in the left pleural space.
<br/><br/>
PROCEDURE DETAIL: After obtaining informed consent, the patient was taken to the minor OR in the Same Day Surgery where his posterior left chest was prepped and draped in a usual fashion. Xylocaine 1% was injected and then a 12-French pigtail catheter was inserted in the medial scapular line about the eighth intercostal space. It was difficult to draw fluid by syringe, but we connected the system to a plastic bag and by gravity started draining at least 400 mL while we were in the minor OR. Samples were sent for culture and sensitivity, aerobic and anaerobic.
<br/><br/>
The patient and I decided to admit him for a period of observation at least overnight.
<br/><br/>
He tolerated the procedure well and the postprocedure chest x-ray showed no complications.
