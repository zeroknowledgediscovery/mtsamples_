<body>Sample Type / Medical Specialty: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary<br/>
Sample Name: Pleurocentesis
<br/><br/>
Description: Ultrasound-guided right pleurocentesis for right pleural effusion with respiratory failure and dyspnea.<br/>
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right pleural effusion with respiratory failure and dyspnea.
<br/><br/>
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right pleural effusion with respiratory failure and dyspnea.
<br/><br/>
PROCEDURE: Ultrasound-guided right pleurocentesis.
<br/><br/>
ANESTHESIA: Local with lidocaine.
<br/><br/>
TECHNIQUE IN DETAIL: After informed consent was obtained from the patient and his mother, the chest was scanned with portable ultrasound. Findings revealed a normal right hemidiaphragm, a moderate right pleural effusion without septation or debris, and no gliding sign of the lung on the right. Using sterile technique and with ultrasound as a guide, a pleural catheter was inserted and serosanguinous fluid was withdrawn, a total of 1 L. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Portable x-ray is pending.
