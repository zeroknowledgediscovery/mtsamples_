Sample Name: Endovascular Brachytherapy
<br/><br/>
Description: Endovascular Brachytherapy (EBT)<br/>
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)<br/>
ENDOVASCULAR BRACHYTHERAPY (EBT)
<br/><br/>
The patient is to undergo a course of angioplasty for in-stent restenosis. The radiotherapy will be planned using simulation films when the Novoste system catheter markers are placed on either side of the coronary artery injury site. After this, a calculation will take place to determine the length of time at which the strontium sources will be left in place to deliver an adequate dose given the reference vessel diameter. The rationale for this treatment is based on radiobiological principles that make this type of therapy more effective than blade atherectomy or laser atherectomy. The does per fraction is individualized for each patient according to radiobiological principles and reference vessel diameter. Given that this is a very high dose rate source and the chances of severe acute toxicity such as cardiac ischemia and machine malfunction are present, it is imperative that the patient be followed closely by myself and monitored for ST segment elevation and correct machine function.
