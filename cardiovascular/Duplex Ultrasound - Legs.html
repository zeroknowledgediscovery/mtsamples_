DUPLEX ULTRASOUND OF LEGS
<br/><br/>
RIGHT LEG: Duplex imaging was carried out according to normal protocol with a 7.5 Mhz imaging probe using B-mode ultrasound. Deep veins were imaged at the level of the common femoral and popliteal veins. All deep veins demonstrated compressibility without evidence of intraluminal thrombus or increased echogenicity.
<br/><br/>
The long saphenous system displayed compressibility without evidence of thrombosis. The long saphenous vein measured * cm at the proximal thigh with reflux of * seconds after release of distal compression and * cm at the knee with reflux of * seconds after release of distal compression. The small saphenous system measured * cm at the proximal calf with reflux of * seconds after release of distal compression.
