<body>Sample Type / Medical Specialty: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary<br/>
Sample Name: Pulmonary Function Test - 2<br/>
<br/>
Description: Pulmonary Function Test to evaluate dyspnea.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
HISTORY: Smoking history zero.
<br/>
INDICATION: Dyspnea with walking less than 100 yards.
<br/><br/>
PROCEDURE: FVC was 59%. FEV1 was 61%. FEV1/FVC ratio was 72%. The predicted was 70%. The FEF 25/75% was 45%, improved from 1.41 to 2.04 with bronchodilator, which represents a 45% improvement. SVC was 69%. Inspiratory capacity was 71%. Expiratory residual volume was 61%. The TGV was 94%. Residual volume was 113% of its predicted. Total lung capacity was 83%. Diffusion capacity was diminished.
<br/>
IMPRESSION:
<br/>1. Moderate restrictive lung disease.
<br/>2. Some reversible small airway obstruction with improvement with bronchodilator.
<br/>3. Diffusion capacity is diminished, which might indicate extrapulmonary restrictive lung disease.
<br/>4. Flow volume loop was consistent with the above and no upper airway obstruction.
