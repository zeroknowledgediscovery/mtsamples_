<br/><br/>
PERSONAL HISTORY: She is a nonsmoker. She does not consume alcohol. No history of recreational drug use.
<br/><br/>
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
<br/>1. Hypothyroidism.
<br/>2. Borderline hypertension.
<br/>3. Arthritis.
<br/>4. Presentation at this time with chest pain and shortness of breath.
<br/><br/>
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
<br/>CONSTITUTIONAL: Weakness, fatigue, and tiredness.
<br/>HEENT: No history of cataract, blurring of vision, or glaucoma.
<br/>CARDIOVASCULAR: Chest pain. No congestive heart failure. No arrhythmia.
<br/>RESPIRATORY: No history of pneumonia in the past, valley fever.
<br/>GASTROINTESTINAL: Epigastric discomfort. No hematemesis or melena.
<br/>UROLOGICAL: Frequency. No urgency. No hematuria.
<br/>MUSCULOSKELETAL: Arthritis and muscle weakness.
<br/>CNS: No TIA. No CVA. No seizure disorder.
<br/>ENDOCRINE: Nonsignificant.
<br/>HEMATOLOGICAL: Nonsignificant.
<br/>
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION<br/>
VITAL SIGNS: Pulse of 86, blood pressure 93/54, afebrile, respiratory rate 16 per minute.<br/>
HEENT: Atraumatic and normocephalic.<br/>
NECK: Supple. Neck veins flat. No significant carotid bruit.<br/>
LUNGS: Air entry bilaterally fair.<br/>
HEART: PMI displaced. S1 and S2 regular.<br/>
ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender.<br/>
EXTREMITIES: No edema. Pulses palpable. No clubbing or cyanosis.<br/>
CNS: Grossly intact.<br/><br/>

LABORATORY DATA: White count of 20 and H&H 13 and 39. BUN and creatinine within normal limits. Cardiac enzyme profile negative.
<br/><br/>
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES: CT of the chest preliminary report, pericardial effusion. Echocardiogram shows pericardial effusion, which appears to be chronic. There is no evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
<br/><br/>
IMPRESSION:
<br/>1. The patient is an 84-year-old female admitted with chest pain and shortness of breath, possibly secondary to pulmonary disorder. She has elevated white count, possible infection.
<br/>2. Pericardial effusion without any hemodynamic compromise, could be chronic.
<br/>3. Cardiac risk factors minimum, except for age and borderline hypertension.
<br/><br/>
RECOMMENDATIONS:
<br/>1. Antibiotic treatment and see how she fares.
<br/>2. Based on response, we will consider cardiac workup in terms of stress test once she is stable.
<br/>3. As for the pericardial effusion, continue with observation.
