Sample Type / Medical Specialty: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary<br/>
Sample Name: Mayoview - 2
<br/><br/>
Description: Lexiscan myoview stress study. Chest discomfort. Normal stress/rest cardiac perfusion with no indication of ischemia. Normal LV function and low likelihood of significant epicardial coronary narrowing.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)<br/>
LEXISCAN MYOVIEW STRESS STUDY
<br/><br/>
REASON FOR THE EXAM: Chest discomfort.
<br/><br/>
INTERPRETATION: The patient exercised according to the Lexiscan study, received a total of 0.4 mg of Lexiscan IV injection. At peak hyperemic effect, 24.9 mCi of Myoview were injected for the stress imaging and earlier 8.2 mCi were injected for the resting and the usual SPECT and gated SPECT protocol was followed and the data was analyzed using Cedars-Sinai software. The patient did not walk because of prior history of inability to exercise long enough on treadmill.
<br/><br/>
The resting heart rate was 57 with the resting blood pressure 143/94. Maximum heart rate achieved was 90 with a maximum blood pressure unchanged.
<br/><br/>
EKG at rest showed sinus rhythm with no significant ST-T wave changes of reversible ischemia or injury. Subtle nonspecific in III and aVF were seen. Maximum stress test EKG showed inverted T wave from V4 to V6. Normal response to Lexiscan.
<br/><br/>
CONCLUSION: Maximal Lexiscan perfusion with subtle abnormalities non-conclusive. Please refer to the Myoview interpretation.
<br/><br/>
MYOVIEW INTERPRETATION: The left ventricle appeared to be normal in size on both stress and rest with no change between the stress and rest with left ventricular end-diastolic volume of 115 and end-systolic of 51. EF estimated and calculated at 56%.
<br/><br/>
Cardiac perfusion reviewed, showed no reversible defect indicative of myocardium risk and no fixed defect indicative of myocardial scarring.
<br/><br/>
IMPRESSION:
<br/>1. Normal stress/rest cardiac perfusion with no indication of ischemia.
<br/>2. Normal LV function and low likelihood of significant epicardial coronary narrowing.
