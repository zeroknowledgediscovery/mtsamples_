Description: Follow up update on patient with left carotid angioplasty and stent placement.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)<br/>
Dear Dr. CD:
<br/><br/>
Please accept this letter of follow up on patient xxx xxx. He is now three months out from a left carotid angioplasty and stent placement. He was a part of a CapSure trial. He has done quite well, with no neurologic or cardiac event in the three months of follow up. He had a follow-up ultrasound performed today that shows the stent to be patent, with no evidence of significant recurrence.
<br/><br/>
Sincerely,
<br/><br/>
XYZ, MD
