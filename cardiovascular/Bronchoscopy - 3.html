Sample Type / Medical Specialty: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary<br/>
Sample Name: Bronchoscopy - 3
<br/><br/>
Description: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy for diagnosis of right lung atelectasis and extensive mucus plugging in right main stem bronchus.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)<br/>
PROCEDURE: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy.
<br/><br/>
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right lung atelectasis.
<br/><br/>
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Extensive mucus plugging in right main stem bronchus.
<br/><br/>
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was carried out at the bedside in the medical ICU after Versed 0.5 mg intravenously given in 2 aliquots. The patient was breathing supplemental nasal and mask oxygen throughout the procedure. Saturations and vital signs remained stable throughout. A flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope was passed through the right naris. The vocal cords were visualized. Secretions in the larynx were as aspirated. As before, he had a mucocele at the right anterior commissure that did not obstruct the glottic opening. The ports were anesthetized and the trachea entered. There was no cough reflex helping explain the propensity to aspiration and mucus plugging. Tracheal secretions were aspirated. The main carinae were sharp. However, there were thick, sticky, grey secretions filling the right mainstem bronchus up to the level of the carina. This was gradually lavaged clear. Saline and Mucomyst solution were used to help dislodge remaining plugs. The airways appeared slightly friable, but were patent after the airways were suctioned. O2 saturations remained in the mid-to-high 90s. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Specimens were submitted for microbiologic examination. Despite his frail status, he tolerated bronchoscopy quite well.
