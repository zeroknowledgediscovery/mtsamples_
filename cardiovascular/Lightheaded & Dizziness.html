During the episode, the patient describes symptoms of palpitation and fluttering of chest. She relates the heart was racing. By the time when she came into the Emergency Room, her EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm. No evidence of arrhythmia. The patient had some cardiac workup in the past, results are as mentioned below. Denies any specific chest pain. Activities fairly stable. She is actively employed. No other cardiac risk factor in terms of alcohol consumption or recreational drug use, caffeinated drink use or over-the-counter medication usage.

<br/><br/>
FAMILY HISTORY: Nonsignificant.
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
PERSONAL HISTORY: She is a nonsmoker. Does not consume alcohol. No history of recreational drug use.
<br/><br/>
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: History of chest pain in the past. Had workup done including nuclear myocardial perfusion scan, which was reportedly abnormal. Subsequently, the patient underwent cardiac catheterization in 11/07, which was also normal. An echocardiogram at that time was also normal. At this time, presentation with lightheaded, dizziness, and palpitation.

<br/><br/>
LABORATORY DATA: H&H stable. BUN and creatinine within normal limits. Cardiac enzyme profile negative. Chest x-ray unremarkable.
<br/><br/>
IMPRESSION:
1. Lightheaded, dizziness in a 50-year-old female. No documented arrhythmia with the symptoms of palpitation.
<br/>2. Normal cardiac structure by echocardiogram a year and half ago.
<br/>3. Normal cardiac catheterization in 11/07.
<br/>4. Negative workup so far for acute cardiac event in terms of EKG, cardiac enzyme profile.
<br/><br/>
RECOMMENDATIONS:
<br/>1. From cardiac standpoint, observation, no other investigation at this juncture.
<br/>2. The patient was started on low dose of beta-blocker and see how she fares. Fortunately, no arrhythmia documented. If there is no documentation of arrhythmia, we will do observation. The patient was started empirically on beta-blocker and workup on outpatient basis explained to her. As mentioned above, she does not have any cardiac risk factors.
