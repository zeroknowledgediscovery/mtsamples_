Sample Type / Medical Specialty: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary<br/>
Sample Name: Heart Catheterization, Ventriculography, & Angiography - 3
<br/><br/>
Description: Left heart catheterization with ventriculography, selective coronary angiography. Standard Judkins, right groin. Catheters used were a 6 French pigtail, 6 French JL4, 6 French JR4.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)<br/>
NAME OF PROCEDURE: Left heart catheterization with ventriculography, selective coronary angiography.
<br/><br/>
INDICATIONS: Acute coronary syndrome.
<br/><br/>
TECHNIQUE OF PROCEDURE: Standard Judkins, right groin. Catheters used were a 6 French pigtail, 6 French JL4, 6 French JR4.
<br/><br/>
ANTICOAGULATION: The patient was on heparin at the time.
<br/><br/>
COMPLICATIONS: None.
<br/><br/>
I reviewed with the patient the pros, cons, alternatives, risks of catheterization and sedation including myocardial infarction, stroke, death, damage to nerve, artery or vein in the leg, perforation of a cardiac chamber, dissection of an artery requiring countershock, infection, bleeding, ATN allergy, need for cardiac surgery. All questions were answered, and the patient desired to proceed.
<br/><br/>
HEMODYNAMIC DATA: Aortic pressure was in the physiologic range. No significant gradient across the aortic valve.
<br/><br/>
ANGIOGRAPHIC DATA
<br/>1. Ventriculogram: The left ventricle is of normal size and shape, normal wall motion, normal ejection fraction.
<br/>2. Right coronary artery: Dominant. There was insignificant disease in the system.
<br/>3. Left coronary: Left main, left anterior descending and circumflex systems showed no significant disease.
<br/><br/>
CONCLUSIONS
<br/>1. Normal left ventricular systolic function.
<br/>2. Insignificant coronary disease.
<br/><br/>
PLAN: Based upon this study, medical therapy is warranted. Six-French Angio-Seal was used in the groin.
