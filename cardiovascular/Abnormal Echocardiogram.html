IMPRESSION:<br/>
1. The patient admitted for gastrointestinal pathology, under working treatment.<br/>
2. History of prior heart murmur with echocardiogram findings as above. Basically revealed normal left ventricular function with left atrial enlargement, large pleural effusion, and severe mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.
<br/><br/>
RECOMMENDATIONS:<br/>
<br/>1. From cardiac standpoint, conservative treatment. Possibility of a transesophageal echocardiogram to assess valvular insufficiency adequately well discussed extensively.
<br/>2. After extensive discussion, given her age 86, limited activity level, and no intention of undergoing any treatment in this regard from a surgical standpoint, the patient does not wish to proceed with a transesophageal echocardiogram.
<br/>3. Based on the above findings, we will treat her medically with ACE inhibitors and diuretics and see how she fares. She has a normal LV function.
