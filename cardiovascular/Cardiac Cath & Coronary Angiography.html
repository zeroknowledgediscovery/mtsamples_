Sample Type / Medical Specialty: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary<br/>
Sample Name: Cardiac Cath & Coronary Angiography<br/><br/>

Description: Left Cardiac Catheterization, Left Ventriculography, Coronary Angiography and Stent Placement.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)<br/>
PROCEDURE: Left Cardiac Catheterization, Left Ventriculography, Coronary Angiography and Stent Placement.
<br/><br/>
INDICATIONS: Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.
<br/><br/>
PATIENT HISTORY: This is a 55-year-old male. He presented with 3 hours of unstable angina.
<br/><br/>
PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: History of previous arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Previous ST elevation MI.
<br/><br/>
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS. The creatinine value is 1.3 mg/dL mg/dL.
<br/><br/>
PROCEDURE MEDICATIONS:<br/>
1. Visipaque 361 mL total dose.<br/>
2. Clopidogrel bisulphate (Plavix) 225 mg PO<br/>
3. Promethazine (Phenergan) 12.5 mg total dose.<br/>
4. Abciximab (Reopro) 10 mg IV bolus<br/>
5. Abciximab (Reopro) 0.125 mcg/kg/minute, 4.5 mL/250 mL D5W x 17 mL<br/>
6. Nitroglycerin 300 mcg IC total dose.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:<br/>
APPROACH: Left heart catheterization via right femoral artery approach.<br/>
ACCESS METHOD: Percutaneous needle puncture.<br/>
<br/><br/>
DEVICES USED:<br/>
1. Balloon catheter utilized: Manufacturer: Boston Sci Quantum Maverick RX 2.75mm x 20mm.<br/><br/>
2. Cordis Vista Brite Tip 6Fr JR 4.0<br/>
3. ACS/Guidant Sport .014" (190cm) Wire<br/>
4. Stent utilized: Boston Sci Taxus RX Stent 3.0mm x 32mm.<br/>
<br/><br/>
FINDINGS/INTERVENTIONS:<br/>
LEFT VENTRICULOGRAPHY: The overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly reduced. Left ventricular ejection fraction is 40% by left ventriculogram. Mild hypokinesis of the anterior wall of the left ventricle. There was no transaortic gradient. Mitral valve regurgitation is not seen.
<br/>LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY: There were no obstructing lesions in the left main coronary artery. Blood flow appeared normal.
<br/>LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY: There was a 95%, discrete stenosis in the mid left anterior descending artery. A drug eluting, Boston Sci Taxus RX Stent 3.0mm x 32mm stent was placed in the mid left anterior descending artery and post-dilated to 3.5 mm. Post-procedure stenosis was 0%. There was no dissection and no perforation.
<br/>LEFT CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY: There was a 50%, diffuse stenosis in the left circumflex artery.
<br/>RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY: The right coronary artery is dominant to the posterior circulation. There were no obstructing lesions in the right coronary artery. Blood flow appeared normal.
<br/><br/>
COMPLICATIONS:<br/>
There were no complications during the procedure.
<br/><br/>
IMPRESSION:<br/>
1. Severe two-vessel coronary artery disease.<br/>
2. Severe left anterior descending coronary artery disease. There was a 95% mid left anterior descending artery stenosis. The lesion was successfully stented.
<br/>3. Moderate left circumflex artery disease. There was a 50% left circumflex artery stenosis. Intervention not warranted.
<br/>4. The overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly reduced with ejection fraction of 40%. Mild hypokinesis of the anterior wall of the left ventricle.
<br/><br/>
RECOMMENDATION:<br/>
1. Clopidogrel (Plavix) 75 mg PO daily for 1 year.<br/>
2. Aggressive risk factor modification of tobacco abuse, hyperlipidemia and hypertension.<br/>
