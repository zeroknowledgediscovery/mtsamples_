<body>Sample Type / Medical Specialty: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary<br/>
Sample Name: Pulmonary Function Test
<br/><br/>
Description: Pulmonary function test. Mild-to-moderate obstructive ventilatory impairment. Some improvement in the airflows after bronchodilator therapy.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)<br/>
OBSERVATIONS: The forced vital capacity is 2.84 L and forced expiratory volume in 1 second is 1.93 L. The ratio between the two is 68%. Small improvement is noted in the airflows after bronchodilator therapy. Lung volumes are increased with a residual volume of 196% of predicted and total lung capacity of 142% of predicted. Single-breath diffusing capacity is slightly reduced.
<br/><br/>
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate obstructive ventilatory impairment. Some improvement in the airflows after bronchodilator therapy.
