Sample Type / Medical Specialty: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary<br/>
Sample Name: Arterial Imaging
<br/><br/>
Description: Arterial imaging of bilateral lower extremities.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)<br/>
INDICATIONS: Peripheral vascular disease with claudication.
<br/><br/>
RIGHT:<br/>
1. Normal arterial imaging of right lower extremity.<br/>
2. Peak systolic velocity is normal.<br/>
3. Arterial waveform is triphasic.<br/>
4. Ankle brachial index is 0.96.<br/><br/>

LEFT:<br/>
1. Normal arterial imaging of left lower extremity.<br/>
2. Peak systolic velocity is normal.<br/>
3. Arterial waveform is triphasic throughout except in posterior tibial artery where it is biphasic.<br/>
4. Ankle brachial index is 1.06.<br/>
<br/>
IMPRESSION:<br/>
