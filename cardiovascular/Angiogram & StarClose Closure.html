Sample Type / Medical Specialty: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary<br/>
Sample Name: Angiogram & StarClose Closure<br/><br/>

Description: Left heart cath, selective coronary angiogram, right common femoral angiogram, and StarClose closure of right common femoral artery.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)<br/>
EXAM: Left heart cath, selective coronary angiogram, right common femoral angiogram, and StarClose closure of right common femoral artery.
<br/><br/>
REASON FOR EXAM: Abnormal stress test and episode of shortness of breath.
<br/><br/>
PROCEDURE: Right common femoral artery, 6-French sheath, JL4, JR4, and pigtail catheters were used.
<br/><br/>
FINDINGS:
1. Left main is a large-caliber vessel. It is angiographically free of disease,<br/>
2. LAD is a large-caliber vessel. It gives rise to two diagonals and septal perforator. It erupts around the apex. LAD shows an area of 60% to 70% stenosis probably in its mid portion. The lesion is a type A finishing before the takeoff of diagonal 1. The rest of the vessel is angiographically free of disease.
<br/>3. Diagonal 1 and diagonal 2 are angiographically free of disease.<br/>
4. Left circumflex is a small-to-moderate caliber vessel, gives rise to 1 OM. It is angiographically free of disease.<br/>
5. OM-1 is angiographically free of disease.<br/>
6. RCA is a large, dominant vessel, gives rise to conus, RV marginal, PDA and one PL. RCA has a tortuous course and it has a 30% to 40% stenosis in its proximal portion.
<br/>7. LVEDP is measured 40 mmHg.<br/>
8. No gradient between LV and aorta is noted.
<br/><br/>
Due to contrast concern due to renal function, no LV gram was performed.
<br/><br/>
Following this, right common femoral angiogram was performed followed by StarClose closure of the right common femoral artery.
<br/><br/>
IMPRESSION:<br/>
1. 60% to 70% mid left anterior descending stenosis.<br/>
2. Mild 30% to 40% stenosis of the proximal right coronary artery.<br/>
3. Status post StarClose closure of the right common femoral artery.<br/>
<br/>
PLAN: Plan will be to perform elective PCI of the mid LAD.
