Sample Type / Medical Specialty: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary<br/>
Sample Name: Myocardial Perfusion Imaging - 2
<br/><br/>
Description: Myocardial perfusion imaging - patient had previous abnormal stress test. Stress test with imaging for further classification of CAD and ischemia.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)<br/>
CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 64-year-old male patient, who had a previous stress test, which was abnormal and hence has been referred for a stress test with imaging for further classification of coronary artery disease and ischemia.
<br/><br/>
PERTINENT MEDICATIONS: Include Tylenol, Robitussin, Colace, Fosamax, multivitamins, hydrochlorothiazide, Protonix and flaxseed oil.
<br/><br/>
With the patient at rest 10.5 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi was injected and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained.
<br/><br/>
PROCEDURE AND INTERPRETATION: The patient exercised for a total of 4 minutes and 41 seconds on the standard Bruce protocol. The peak workload was 7 METs. The resting heart rate was 61 beats per minute and the peak heart rate was 173 beats per minute, which was 85% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate response. The blood pressure response was normal with the resting blood pressure 126/86, and the peak blood pressure of 134/90. EKG at rest showed normal sinus rhythm with a right-bundle branch block. The peak stress EKG was abnormal with 2 mm of ST segment depression in V3 to V6, which remained abnormal till about 6 to 8 minutes into recovery. There were occasional PVCs, but no sustained arrhythmia. The patient had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia at peak stress. The ischemic threshold was at a heart rate of 118 beats per minute and at 4.6 METs. At peak stress, the patient was injected with 30.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained, and was compared to resting images.
<br/><br/>
MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING:
<br/>1. The overall quality of the scan was fair in view of increased abdominal uptake, increased bowel uptake seen.
<br/>2. There was a large area of moderate to reduced tracer concentration seen in the inferior wall and the inferior apex. This appeared to be partially reversible in the resting images.
<br/>3. The left ventricle appeared normal in size.
<br/>4. Gated SPECT images revealed normal wall motion and normal left ventricular systolic function with normal wall thickening. The calculated ejection fraction was 70% at rest.
<br/>
CONCLUSIONS:
<br/>1. Average exercise tolerance.
<br/>2. Adequate cardiac stress.
<br/>3. Abnormal EKG response to stress, consistent with ischemia. No symptoms of chest pain at rest.
<br/>4. Myocardial perfusion imaging was abnormal with a large-sized, moderate intensity partially reversible inferior wall and inferior apical defect, consistent with inferior wall ischemia and inferior apical ischemia.
<br/>5. The patient had run of SVT at peak stress.
<br/>6. Gated SPECT images revealed normal wall motion and normal left ventricular systolic function.
