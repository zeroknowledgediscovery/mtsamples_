Sample Type / Medical Specialty: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary<br/>
Sample Name: Cardiac Consultation - 7
<br/><br/>
Description: The patient has a previous history of aortic valve disease, status post aortic valve replacement, a previous history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, a previous history of transient ischemic attack with no residual neurologic deficits.<br/>
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)<br/>
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 41-year-old African-American male previously well known to me. He has a previous history of aortic valve disease, status post aortic valve replacement on 10/15/2007, for which he has been on chronic anticoagulation. There is a previous history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, both of which have been stable prior to this admission. He has a previous history of transient ischemic attack with no residual neurologic deficits.<br/><br/>

The patient has undergone surgery by Dr. X for attempted nephrolithotomy. The patient has experienced significant postoperative bleeding, for which it has been necessary to discontinue all anticoagulation. The patient is presently seen at the request of Dr. X for management of anticoagulation and his above heart disease.

<br/><br/>
ALLERGIES: None.
<br/><br/>
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:<br/>
General: A well-appearing, obese black male.<br/>
Vital Signs: BP 140/80, HR 88, respirations 16, and afebrile.
HEENT: Grossly normal.<br/>
Neck: Normal. Thyroid, normal. Carotid, normal upstroke, no bruits.
Chest: Midline sternotomy scar.<br/>
Lungs: Clear.<br/>
Heart: PMI fifth intercostal space mid clavicular line. Normal S1 and prosthetic S2. No murmur, rub, gallop, or click.<br/>
Abdomen: Soft and nontender. No palpable mass or hepatosplenomegaly.<br/>
Extremities: Normal. No edema. Pulses bilaterally intact, carotid, radial, femoral, and dorsalis pedis.<br/>
Neurologic: Mental status, no gross cranial nerve, motor, or sensory deficits.
<br/><br/>
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM: Normal sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Findings compatible with old anteroseptal and lateral wall myocardial infarction.
_______ nonspecific ST-T abnormality.
<br/><br/>
IMPRESSION:<br/>
1. Status post nephrolithotomy with postoperative hematuria.<br/>
2. Aortic valve disease, status post aortic valve replacement on 10/15/2007.<br/>
3. Congestive heart failure, diastolic, chronic, stable, NYSHA class I to II.<br/>
4. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.<br/>
5. Status post remote transient ischemic attack with no residual neurologic deficits.<br/>
6. Type I diabetes mellitus.<br/>
7. Hyperlipidemia.<br/>
8. Hypertension.<br/>
9. Morbid obesity.<br/>
10. Sleep apnea syndrome.<br/>
11. Chronic therapeutic anticoagulation.<br/><br/>

RECOMMENDATIONS: Until resolution of the hematuria, I agree with the necessity of discontinuation of all anticoagulation. There is obvious risk both due to prosthetic aortic valve and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with continuation of anticoagulation; however, the risk of uncontrolled bleeding is essentially worse.
Continue other medications. <br/><br/>
