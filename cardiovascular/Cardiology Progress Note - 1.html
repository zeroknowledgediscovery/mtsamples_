<body>Sample Type / Medical Specialty: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary<br/>
Sample Name: Cardiology Progress Note - 1
<br/>
Description: Congestive heart failure due to rapid atrial fibrillation and systolic dysfunction.<br/>
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)<br/>
SUBJECTIVE: The patient is not in acute distress.
<br/><br/>
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:<br/>
VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure of 121/63, pulse is 75, and O2 saturation is 94% on room air.<br/>
HEAD AND NECK: Face is symmetrical. Cranial nerves are intact.<br/>
CHEST: There is prolonged expiration.<br/>
CARDIOVASCULAR: First and second heart sounds are heard. No murmur was appreciated.<br/>
ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender. Bowel sounds are positive.<br/>
EXTREMITIES: He has 2+ pedal swelling.<br/>
NEUROLOGIC: The patient is asleep, but easily arousable.<br/><br/>
<br/>
LABORATORY DATA: PTT is 49. INR is pending. BUN is improved to 20.6, creatinine is 0.7, sodium is 123, and potassium is 3.8. AST is down to 45 and ALT to 99.
<br/>
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: Nuclear stress test showed moderate size, mostly fixed defect involving the inferior wall with a small area of peri-infarct ischemia. Ejection fraction is 25%.
<br/>
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:<br/>
1. Congestive heart failure due to rapid atrial fibrillation and systolic dysfunction. Continue current treatment as per Cardiology. We will consider adding ACE inhibitors as renal function improves.<br/>
2. Acute pulmonary edema, resolved.<br/>
3. Rapid atrial fibrillation, rate controlled. The patient is on beta-blockers and digoxin. Continue Coumadin. Monitor INR.<br/>
4. Coronary artery disease with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Continue beta-blockers.<br/>
5. Urinary tract infection. Continue Rocephin.<br/>
6. Bilateral perfusion secondary to congestive heart failure. We will monitor.<br/>
7. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stable.<br/>
8. Abnormal liver function due to congestive heart failure with liver congestion, improving.<br/>
9. Rule out hypercholesterolemia. We will check lipid profile.<br/>
10. Tobacco smoking disorder. The patient has been counseled.<br/>
11. Hyponatremia, stable. This is due to fluid overload. Continue diuresis as per Nephrology.<br/>
12. Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. The patient is on heparin drip.
