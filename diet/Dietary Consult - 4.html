SUBJECTIVE: The patient is keeping a food journal that she brought in. She is counting calorie points, which ranged 26 to 30 per day. She is exercising pretty regularly. She attends Overeaters Anonymous and her sponsor is helping her and told her to get some ideas on how to plan snacks to prevent hypoglycemia. The patient requests information on diabetic exchanges.

I praised her record keeping. I gave her a list of the diabetic exchanges and explained them. I also gave her a food dairy sheet so that she could record exchanges. I encouraged her to continue.
