On a chest x-ray for what appeared to be shortness of breath she was found to have what was thought to be free air under the right diaphragm.

<br/><br/>
X-ray of the chest shows the possibility of free air; therefore, a CT scan was obtained because of the patient's physical examination, which shows no evidence of intra-abdominal pathology. The etiology of the air under the diaphragm is actually a colonic air that is anterior superior to the dome of the diaphragm, near the dome of the liver.
<br/><br/>
ASSESSMENT: No intra-abdominal pathology.
<br/><br/>
PLAN: Have her admitted to the medical service for treatment of her hyponatremia.
